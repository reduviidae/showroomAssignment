# showroomAssignment

To test the app, you will only need to download the directory frontend/showroom_assignment_client. From within that directory run ```yarn``` then ```yarn start```.

For the sake of simplicity, the backend has been deployed to Heroku, and so nothing needs to be done. 

The branding text, "TV Show Watchlist" in the navbar will take the user to the main paige.
"Home" will take the user to their own profile page. A user can add a show from a button at the bottom of their profile page.
"Users" will display the list of all users. Click on any user from the list to see their profile page.
"TV Shows" will display the list of all shows. Click on any show title from the list to see show details including comments.
"Genres" will display the list of all genres. There is nothing to click on this page.
